# 1) Starting the project
## The idea
Launch a bunch of Christmas themed objects at a platform to create your perfect Christmas picture.

## Tools
I'm making a website, so JavaScript will be there somewhere. Everything else is up in the air.

I've heard Gatsby is a common website creating tool, so I'll use that. In the past, I've used other people's physics engine and I always got confused. Let's see how creating my own physics engine goes. I also like TypeScript and Jest, so let's add those in as well.

[Gatsby quick start](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/)
```shell
npx gatsby new christmas-2020
cd christmas-2020
tmux
gatsby develop -p 8080
```

Set up [git](https://github.com/jarett-lee/christmas-2020)
```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/jarett-lee/christmas-2020.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main # Authentication handled by VSCode
