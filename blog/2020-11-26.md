# 2) Adding all the tools I like

## Commits

- Remove default export

  I avoid default export because I don't like the extra `default export` line and I think named exports work slightly better with refactoring.

  `src/pages/index.js` can't use a named export because Gatsby expects a default export.

- Format

  I formatted using Prettier and I found another way to include explicit spaces.

  ```tsx
  <div>Icons made by{` `}</div>
  ```

- Change package.json license to MIT

  I forgot to do this in the "Change license to MIT" commit [yesterday](./2020-11-25.md).

- Add ESLint

  We already have prettier installed, so I plan on only using ESLint for code quality rules and continuing to use prettier for stylistic rules.

  https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html

  ```
  $ npm install typescript
  $ npm install --save-dev eslint

  $ npx eslint --init
  ✔ How would you like to use ESLint? · problems
  ✔ What type of modules does your project use? · commonjs
  ✔ Which framework does your project use? · react
  ✔ Does your project use TypeScript? · No / Yes
  ✔ Where does your code run? · browser
  ✔ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript
  The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:

  eslint-plugin-react@latest @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest @typescript-eslint/parser@latest
  ✔ Would you like to install them now with npm? · No / Yes

  $ npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import
  ```

  Enforce no default export using ESLint

  ```json
  plugins: [
    "import",
  ],
  rules: {
    "import/no-default-export": "error",
  },
  ```

  All the files in `src/pages` needs to use default export, so I turned it off just for that folder by adding an additional `.eslintrc.js` with that one rule turned off.

  If I needed to turn off the rule for one file, I would use the following eslint configuration comment at the top of the file.

  ```tsx
  /* eslint import/no-default-export: "off" */
  ```

- Use TypeScript

  https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-typescript/

  ```
  npm install --save-dev @types/react-helmet
  tsc --init
  ```

  Change `tsconfig.json` `jsx` default to `react`

  ```
  "jsx": "react",                           /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */
  ```

  The `Layout` component "requires" children, but children is automatically populated with `React.ReactNode` and the component functions fine without children, so I removed the requirement. You can prevent `<Layout />` by requiring children to be `NonNullable<React.ReactNode>`, but that still doesn't really force the user to add children.

  Gatsby injects `PageProps` by default.

  I made some major changes to seo.js when converting it to seo.tsx, so I had to put in an intermediate commit to make sure git detected the rename. In the future, I would recommend separating all of the renames into it's own step.

- Fix lint errors and format

  `' = &apos;` and `" = &quot;`

- Add Jest

  https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/unit-testing/

  ```shell
  npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest react-test-renderer babel-preset-gatsby identity-obj-proxy
  ```

  Look at the gatsby docs and the commit to see how to set this up.

  Make eslint work with jest.

  ```shell
  npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-jest
  ```

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    extends: ["plugin:jest/recommended"],
  }
  ```

- ("Add Jest" follow-up) Move files to typescript

  ```shell
  npm install --save-dev @types/react-test-renderer
  ```

  Override ESLint rules for specific files.

  ```js
  // .eslintrc.js
  module.exports = {
    overrides: [
      {
        files: ["*.js"],
        rules: {
          "@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires": "off",
        },
      },
    ],
  }
  ```

- Add restrictive page export rules

## Tangents

### Git pager

I use `git log --oneline` to print the commit ids to the terminal so I can copy them for other git commands, but the default behavior on my home server is to print the log to `less` or a similar program. I found out that this behavior is called pagination in git and is related to the pager options. By specifying `--no-pager` I can print directly to the terminal.view

```shell
git --no-pager log --oneline
```

### oh-my-zsh HEAD^

`git diff HEAD^` doesn't work by default with oh-my-zsh because EXTENDED_GLOB is on by default and `^` is a character that's used by extended globbing. I don't use extended globbing often, so I edited my `.zshrc` file to have extended globbing off by default.

```shell
setopt noEXTENDED_GLOB
```

### React, TypeScript, and defaultProps

I don't understand which way I should do default props with React TypeScript components. My favorite solution is to use the fully TypeScript method which involves defining an interface then adding the default props when destructuring.

```tsx
type MetaProps = React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.MetaHTMLAttributes<HTMLMetaElement>, HTMLMetaElement>

interface SeoProps {
  description?: string
  lang?: string
  meta?: MetaProps[]
  title: string
}

export const Seo: React.FC<SeoProps> = ({
  description = ``,
  lang = `en`,
  meta = [],
  title,
}) => {
```

This strategy has two limitations.

1. It's verbose if you want to list all of the properties under `props`. Some people like to explicitly show that the values are being passed in as props. I find that it's fast enough for me to jump to the variable definition, so I'm fine without explicitly using `props`.

```tsx
export const Seo: React.FC<SeoProps> = ({
  description = ``,
  lang = `en`,
  meta = [],
  ...rest
}) => {
  const props = {
    description,
    lang,
    meta,
    ...rest,
  }
```

2. There's no good way if you want to view the default properties using the React Dev Tools extension. This is fine, since `defaultProps` on functional components will eventually get deprecated and I don't use the React Dev Tools extension too much.

```tsx
interface SeoDefaultProps {
  description: string
  lang: string
  meta: MetaProps[]
}

interface SeoNonDefaultProps {
  title: string
}

interface SeoExternalProps extends Partial<SeoDefaultProps>, SeoNonDefaultProps {}
interface SeoInternalProps extends SeoDefaultProps, SeoNonDefaultProps {}

const defaultProps: SeoDefaultProps = {
  description: ``,
  lang: `en`,
  meta: [],
}

export const Seo: React.FC<SeoExternalProps> = (props) => {
  const {
    description,
    lang,
    meta,
    title,
  } = (props as SeoInternalProps)

...

Seo.defaultProps = defaultProps
```
